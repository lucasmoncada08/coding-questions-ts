# coding-questions-ts
Typescript project to write more code during non-work hours. Goal of becoming more of Coding Machine archetype.

Goals:
I recently noticed that in order to grow as an engineer I need to push myself to continue to improve not only my tech lead skills, but also my pure IC skills. This comes with practice. This repo is part of my larger approach, and revolves around finding 30-50mins to take a coding problem and solve it using Typescript with Unit Testing, then take some time to refactor it so that it would be deployable code.
